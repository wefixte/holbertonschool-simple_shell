----------

**Simple replication of the command-line interpreter Shell. All files are written in C language.**
    
----------


## Overview:

The shell is a command that reads lines from the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes the commands. 
This type of program is often referred to as a command-line shell or just a shell. Its primary purpose is to interpret user commands and execute them by interacting with the operating system's kernel.


----------

## Requirements:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your C programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-doc.pl)
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded
- Use system calls only when you need to [why?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-system-calls-expensive-in-operating-systems)

----------


## Compilation:
Created and tested with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Compiled with GCC 4.8.4 with flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

Code files must be compiled this way:

`$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`

## Man Page:
You can access the man page of the project by doing this command :
`man ./man_1_simple_shell`

----------
## Builtin Functions:


| Command |  Description | 
| -------- | -------- |
| env  | display the environmental variables |
|  exit    | exit the shell |
        

## Usage:

The Simple Shell should work like this in interactive mode (simple commands can be typed directly to the running shell):

```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```

And also in non-interactive mode :

```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```

## Exiting the shell 
When you want to exit the shell, you can use one of the following methods:

1: Type the command "exit"

`exit`

2: Press on Ctrl + D

`2: Press on Ctrl + D`

## Files:

| File | Description 
| -------- | -------- |
| main.h   |Header file with function declarations and includes needed for the shell program.    |
| getpath.c | This function gets the path to the executable files from the environment variable PATH. It opens the PATH environment variable and reads the value into a buffer. It then splits the buffer into individual paths, storing them in an array. |
| execute_command.c  | The provided C code defines a function execute_command that executes a given command. It tokenizes the command, determines the path, and uses execve to execute the command. The function handles errors and returns 1 on success. | 
| read.c | This function reads a line of input from the user. It first opens the standard input stream (stdin) and reads a character from it. If the character is a newline character, it stops reading and returns the line of input. If the character is not a newline character, it stores it in a buffer and then reads the next character. | 
| tokenization.c | This function takes a string as input and splits it into individual tokens. It first allocates memory for an array of tokens. It then iterates over the string, splitting it into tokens using the whitespace character as a delimiter. Each token is stored in the array of tokens. Finally, it returns the array of tokens.|
| Shell.c    | This is the main function of the shell program. It calls the getpath function to get the path to the executable files. It then enters a loop that repeatedly reads a line of input from the user, splits it into tokens, and executes the command. If the command is the exit command, the loop terminates.|
